### **Case Study 2: Data Breach at a Social Media Company**
A group of hackers exploited a security flaw in a social media platform to steal user data and sell it on the dark web. Millions of users’ personal information were exposed without consent.  
**Classification:** ❌ *Unethical (Illegal) Hacking*  
**Justification:** The attack was unauthorized and intended for financial gain, violating privacy and cybercrime laws.

### **Case Study 3: Student Accessing School Database**
A student bypassed his school’s network security to change grades and access restricted files. He did not have permission from administrators.
